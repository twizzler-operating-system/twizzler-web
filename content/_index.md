Twizzler is a research operating system designed around the data-centric programming model. It is
built from scratch with a new kernel focused on simplicity to facilitate direct access to shared,
persistent data for applications with minimal OS involvement and interposition. Twizzler is
motivated by the convergence of the memory hierarchy for traditionally "far away" memory, brought
about by the increasing closeness of persistent and distributed memory. Twizzler is developed by the [CRSS](https://crss.us/index.html)
at UC Santa Cruz.
